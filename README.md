# SMS_Spam_Classifier-using-ML
This project is a **machine learning** application that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (legitimate)** using **Naive Bayes** and **TF-IDF vectorization**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and encodes labels (`ham` ‚Üí 0, `spam` ‚Üí 1)
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts raw text into feature vectors
* **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Efficient baseline model for text classification
* **GridSearchCV**: Optimizes model hyperparameters for the best performance
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, and detailed classification report

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **pandas** ‚Äî for data handling
* **scikit-learn** ‚Äî for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation

---

## üìÇ Dataset

* The model uses a CSV file named `spam.csv` containing two columns:

  * `v1`: label (`ham` or `spam`)
  * `v2`: SMS message
* The file is loaded using `pd.read_csv()` with `latin-1` encoding.
